# Contact_Form

Contact form implementation:

● When clicking the “Submit” button, the required fields are being validated, and a
red border around the input is displayed, if validation fails.

● If the error gets corrected, the red border is removed.

● When the form is successfully submitted (with no validation errors) a
confirmation banner (which is hidden initially) is displayed, containing the user’s first name.
